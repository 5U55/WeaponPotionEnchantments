# Weapon Potion Effect Enchantments

With five new Enchantments you can now add potion effects to your target when fighting. Any living entity that gets hit with a sword that has one of these enchantments will be granted the status effect. These Enchantments can be put on swords either from the enchantment table or from being combined with a book of that enchantment. Books can be obtained by enchanting a book on an enchantment table or by trading with villagers. These enchantments are not compatable with eachothe and each enchantment has its own texture for the swords.
